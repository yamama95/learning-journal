# How Computers Work

## Computer Hardware
*The computer is an amazingly useful general-purpose technology, to the point that now cameras, phones, thermostats .. these are all now little computers. This section will cover a lot of ground, introducing major parts and themes of how computer hardware works. "Hardware" refers the physical parts of the computer, and "software" refers to the code that runs on the computer. These are deep and complicated topics, but many of the basic principles make perfect sense and will give you an insight about what's going on behind the scenes.*

## computer Software
*Software is the programs or instructions that run a computer system. Software works with hardware in that software provides the instructions and hardware actually carries out the work*

## computer Cpu
*is The Central Processing Unit,The computer does its primary work in a part of the machine we cannot see, a control center that converts data input to information output. This control center, called the central processing unit (CPU), is a highly complex, extensive set of electronic circuitry that executes stored program instructions. All computers, large and small, must have a central processing unit. As Figure 1 shows, the central processing unit consists of two parts: The control unit and the arithmetic/logic unit. Each part has a specific function

## Memory
*Memory is also known as primary storage, primary memory, main storage, internal storage, main memory, and RAM (Random Access Memory); all these terms are used interchangeably by people in computer circles*
